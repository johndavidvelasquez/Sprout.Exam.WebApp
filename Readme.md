## If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or an architectural design.
I will be prioritizing on improving and adding more properties that can be saved on the database to make the app more scalable, for example adding a column for Salary, due to possibility of different Employee (even with same type) can have a different salary. A time in and timeout feature for employees would be also a great addition, from there we can base or calculate their salary based on their attendance, instead of manually inputting the days worked and etc.
